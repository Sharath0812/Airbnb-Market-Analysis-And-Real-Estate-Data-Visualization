The project aims to provide insights into rental revenue trends, property prices, occupancy ratios, and amenities distribution to help real estate investors, property managers, city planners, and community stakeholders make informed decisions. The project consists of two phases:
* Phase One: Selection and cleaning of the dataset, and formulation of research questions.
* Phase Two: Creation of a project context, a 3-minute story, a big idea, storyboarding, four data visualization charts, and an interactive dashboard in Tableau.
